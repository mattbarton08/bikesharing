## Overview of the analysis: 
<br>
The purpose of this analysis was to examine Citibike data from New York City and decide whether it would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. <br>

## Results:

As we can see, the majority of Citibike users use their bikes for less than an hour. <br>

While the majority of Citibike users are males, there is no major difference in trip durations across the genders. <br>

This chart shows that most users take their trips during commuting hours, which suggests that most users use their bikes to either commute to and from work or school. <br>

The hours that bikes are used does not differ very much across genders either. The majority of riders use their bikes during commuting hours during the week and in the afternoon during the weekends. <br>

Most rides take place in the center of the city. <br>

## Summary: 
Based on all of these observations, I believe that Citibike would do well in Des Moines. While there are less tourist attractions than in New York City, the data shows that most bikes are used for commuting rather than exploring the city. Also, the fact that most riders are annual subscribers shows that the majority of Citibike users are local and use the bikes as their mode of transportation.  We can also see that most of Citibike users are younger people between the ages of 20 and 40, which Des Moines has a lot of. One additional visualization I would perform is trip duration vs. user type, to see whether subscribers or customers take longer trips. One more I would perform would be trip duration by location to see where people are taking longer rides.
